# Basic-Ecomerce--Website

I  have created a basic Ecommerce website where there is a navigation bar and a "Explore Now" button. There is also an offer area a feture product area and latest product area.After this there is also a footer part of the website.

After this when we click the "Explore Now" button it will go to another page i.e "ALL PRODUCT PAGE" where we can find all the products and below there are the 1,2,3,4 page buttons when you click the 2 button it will redirect you to the next page...

If we want to see a details of a product then we have to just click on the product and it will open the product details page. Here, in my project i have created the product details for one product only ,if you want to have product details for every product it is very much easy, just you have to repear=t the same process as done in "product details.html".

When you will pressn the cart logo it will edirect you to the cart page.

And when you want to go to the registration or login page you have to just click on the   ACCOUNT in the nav bar....
